- write a setup.py to produce a dev env where script are in path
- clize every script
- Implement and use SyncWrite when needed
- Implement constraint config for a model (cw/ccw angle limit) and a script to produce it by inverse kinematic (Moving the motors extends the limits)
- All state/position/constraint code must be independant of servo id
